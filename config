#       The path to the file which lists the target servers.
#       The file is in the form "number.key value" (note
#       the space between key and value).  The number
#       indicates the server.  Lines beginning with '#' in
#       the serverListFile are ignored.  Possible keys are:
#         name:     Name to identify the server in logs, as
#                   well as in the name of the file for the
#                   backups (optional)
#         host:     Hostname of the mysql server
#         port:     Port on which to connect to the mysql

#         preMysql: Anything put here will be inserted in the
#                   same line as the mysql and mysqldump
#                   commands.  This may be used to send the
#                   commands over ssh or some other shell
#                   (optional)
#         include:  A space-separated list of databases 
#                   on the server to be included. (optional)
# * logLevel:
#       Integer from 1-4 which defines the verbosity
#       of the logging. Each level implies those below it.
#       Logging levels are:
#         1 [ERROR]: only log fatal errors
#         2  [WARN]: log warnings which may be recovered
#         3  [INFO]: log information about the main stages
#                    of the program's execution
#         4 [DEBUG]: log as much information about the
#                    execution and state as possible
# * mysqldump_args:
#       Arguments supplied to the mysqldump command
# * zipper:
#       Compression tool used for backups.  Must be set
#       to take input from stdin and output to stdout
# * zipperExt:
#       The filename extension associated with files
#       compressed with $zipper
# * hasher:
#       Hashing tool used on database backups.  Must take a
#       single file as an argument and output to stdout
# * hasherExt:
#       The filename extension associated with the hashing
#       algorithm used by $hasher
